### Hello folks, this is Vipul :hatching_chick:

Apart from my love for [party parrots](https://github.com/vipulgupta2048/partystarter) and [vanilla](https://mixstersite.wordpress.com), I build stuff at [balena](https://balena.io) and don't just write docs at [Mixster](https://bit.ly/whatmixster). I am based out of the satellite city, Noida. And, have been around the sun for about 21 times. In that time, I have become a pseudo graduate no thanks to the pandemic. Spent weeks in layovers, railway stations, ports and bus stands backpacking solo and try to document it as much as I can in my blog, [Mixster](https://mixstersite.wordpress.com). 

I [write](http://mixstersite.wordpress.com/), [speak](https://github.com/vipulgupta2048/talkswith2048/edit/master/README.md#talks-with-2048), [design](https://github.com/vipulgupta2048/talkswith2048/edit/master/README.md#design-by-2048), [attend](https://github.com/vipulgupta2048/talkswith2048/edit/master/README.md#conferences-with-2048), [participate](https://github.com/vipulgupta2048/talkswith2048/edit/master/README.md#google-summer-of-code-with-2048) and [organise](https://meetup.com/pydelhi) a ton of things over the weekends as a way of giving back to open-source. No, I don't like [2048, the game](https://github.com/vipulgupta2048/talkswith2048/edit/master/README.md#about-2048) to have the same digits be in my username. And, yes I do create memes every week at my workplace! I call it `memes "no one asked for" as a service` just like this weird introduction I am writing right now.
