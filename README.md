### Hello folks, this is Vipul :hatching_chick:

Apart from my love for [party parrots](https://github.com/vipulgupta2048/partystarter) and [vanilla](https://mixstersite.wordpress.com), I build stuff at [balena](https://balena.io) and don't just write docs at [Mixster](https://bit.ly/whatmixster). Based out the satellite city, Noida situated in India. I have been around the sun for about 21 times now. And, in that timespan I have collectively spent weeks in layovers, railway stations, boats and buses backpacking solo since I was 19. I like reading about product design, human psychology, startup growth and anything I can tap into for inspiration. I enjoy Ted-Ed videos a bit too much. No, I don't really like [2048, the game](https://github.com/vipulgupta2048/talkswith2048/edit/master/README.md#about-2048) to have the same digits as my username. And, yes I do create memes every week at my workplace! I call it `memes "no one asked for" as a service` just like this weird introduction I am writing right now.

I [write](http://mixstersite.wordpress.com/), [speak](https://github.com/vipulgupta2048/talkswith2048/edit/master/README.md#talks-with-2048), [design](https://github.com/vipulgupta2048/talkswith2048/edit/master/README.md#design-by-2048), [attend](https://github.com/vipulgupta2048/talkswith2048/edit/master/README.md#conferences-with-2048), [participate](https://github.com/vipulgupta2048/talkswith2048/edit/master/README.md#google-summer-of-code-with-2048) and [organise](https://meetup.com/pydelhi) a ton of things on the side and over the weekends. You might say my work life balance is messed up. But, I can't hear you over the sound of 2020 crashing my life and my code. Imposter syndrome has been a distant relative of mine and someday I wish to visit the aurora borealis from Greenland.
