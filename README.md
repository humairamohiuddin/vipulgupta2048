### Hello folks, this is Vipul :hatching_chick:

Apart from my love for [party parrots](https://github.com/vipulgupta2048/partystarter) and [vanilla](https://mixstersite.wordpress.com), I build stuff at [balena](https://balena.io) and don't just write docs at [Mixster](https://bit.ly/whatmixster).

I [write](http://mixstersite.wordpress.com/), [speak](https://github.com/vipulgupta2048/talkswith2048/edit/master/README.md#talks-with-2048), [design](https://github.com/vipulgupta2048/talkswith2048/edit/master/README.md#design-by-2048), [attend](https://github.com/vipulgupta2048/talkswith2048/edit/master/README.md#conferences-with-2048), [participate](https://github.com/vipulgupta2048/talkswith2048/edit/master/README.md#google-summer-of-code-with-2048) and [organise](https://meetup.com/pydelhi) a ton of things over the weekends as a way of giving back to open-source. No, I don't like [2048, the game](https://github.com/vipulgupta2048/talkswith2048/edit/master/README.md#about-2048) to have the same digits be in my username and I review cheesecakes in each country I visit.
